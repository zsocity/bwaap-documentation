bWAPP Exploitation Walkthrough This repo documents my progress through bWAPP, a vulnerable web app designed for web security practice. Here, you'll find exploit code, payloads, and detailed notes covering SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, RCE, and more. This project is helping me build and refine my web vulnerability assessment and exploitation skills.
