![bWAPP Logo](http://www.itsecgames.com/images/bee_1.png)

**bWAPP Vulnerability Exploitation** is my personal journey through bWAPP, a vulnerable web application designed for security training. This project documents my exploration and exploitation of all 100 vulnerabilities included in bWAPP. My goal is to understand and practice various web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Remote Code Execution, and more.
